logviewer
=========

An 'Atmosphere' based log viewer for simulating a Unix tail command in a browser.

Sometime ago I have asked a [question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5803776/java-web-application-that-can-stream-the-content-of-an-arbitrary-file-to-the-brow) on Stackoverflow about the existence of a web application that could be used to tail on an arbitrary log file located on the server.
